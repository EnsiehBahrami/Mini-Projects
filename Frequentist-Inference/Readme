Business Problem:
An administrator is working on the hospital's business operations plan and needs me to help them answer some business questions.
I'm going to use frequentist statistical inference on a data sample to answer the questions:

1) Has the hospital's revenue stream fallen below a key threshold (12000$)?
2) Are patients with insurance really charged different amounts than those without?


Techniques:
There are two parts to the case study. In part A covers the Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference. 
In Part B, I will apply those implementations to a real-world scenario. 

I will be implementing the following concepts through the case study:
The z-statistic
The t-statistic
The Central Limit Theorem
Estimation of the population standard deviation and mean, from a sample
Sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
Calculating confidence intervals and p-values
Hypothesis testing
