<font color='teal'>Importance of eclidean and manthattan distance:
In this short mini project you will see examples and comparisons of distance measures. Specifically, I visually compared the Euclidean distance to the Manhattan 
distance measures. 

The application of distance measures has a multitude of uses in data science and is the foundation of many algorithms, such as Prinical Components Analysis.
