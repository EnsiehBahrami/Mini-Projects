Cosine similarity:
It is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. This similarity measurement is 
particularly concerned with orientation, rather than magnitude.  

Importance of Cosine Similarity:
Similarity measures have a multiude of uses in machine learning projects; they come in handy when matching strings, measuring distance, and extracting features. 


In this case study, I will use the cosine similarity to compare both a numeric data within a plane and a text dataset for string matching.


Technichal methods:
  1) sklearn.metrics.pairwise module
