Business Problem:
I can choose to integrate the Apple Store or Google Play, but not both. I want to use the platform that sells the best quality apps. 
So, I decide to use the app ratings as a quality metric and gather some data about rating from the two stores. 

In this case study, I will analyze whether there is a significant difference between the ratings on these two platforms that would justify choosing one over the other. 
If there's not, I can always just flip a coin to pick which platform to use at random. 



Technical stages of the project:

1. Sourcing and loading 
    * Load the two datasets
    * Pick the columns that we are going to work with 
    * Subsetting the data on this basis 
 
 
2. Cleaning, transforming and visualizing
    * Check the data types and fix them
    * Add a `platform` column to both the `Apple` and the `Google` dataframes
    * Changing the column names to prepare for a join 
    * Join the two data sets
    * Eliminate the `NaN` values
    * Filter only those apps that have been reviewed at least once
    * Summarize the data visually and analytically (by the column `platform`)  
  
  
3. Modelling 
    * Hypothesis formulation
    * Getting the distribution of the data
    * Permutation test 


4. Evaluating and concluding
