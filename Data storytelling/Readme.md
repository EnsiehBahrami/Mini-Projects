## Business Problem:
There are historic data about more than 2400 invoices related to 100 customers in 5 countries. All the invoices have been settled. Based on the historic data, I am going to:

    1) build a predictive model that predicts the number of days that an invoice will be settled (Days to Settle)
    2) find the most important features that impact on the number of days to settle


## Techniques:
* Feature engineering
* Optimized RandomForest Regressor using RandomizedSearchCV and Bayesian Optimization 
* Optimized Elastic Net using RandomizedSearchCV
* GrandientBoosting Regressor
