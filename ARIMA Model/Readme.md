## Business Problem:
The available post-war historical data runs for only 11 years after they resumed production in 1949; stopping in 1960 before resuming again in 1970. 
I want to use the 1949-1960 data to predict whether the manufacturer's cigarette sales actually increased, decreased, or stayed the same. 

## Technical Steps:
1. Sourcing and loading
2. Cleaning, transforming and visualizing
3. Modelling
 
    Decomposition
    
    Testing for stationarity with KPSS
    
    Making the data stationary
    
    The ARIMA Model
    
    Evaluate the different ARIMA models with different p, d, and q values
    
    Visualize the results
    
    Application: Forecasting
4. Evaluating and concluding
