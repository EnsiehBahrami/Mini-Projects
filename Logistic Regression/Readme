Classification problem: Predicting gender based on height and weight of a person.

The height and wight of 10,000 male and female are available. Height and weight of both class have noraml distributions with diffrent mean and std. I tried to find a 
maximum-margin classifier where constructs a decision boundary that is far as possible away from both classes of points. Logistic regressor classifier has 92% accuracy on 
both test and training sets.


Techniques:
logistic regression
GridSearchCv: cross validating to find the best regularization strength
